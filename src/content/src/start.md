# Start

This chapter -- Start -- starts you, the Reader, off in reading the rest of this work. Think of it as a "meta introduction" with the real introduction coming in the next section.
This meta introduction describes the tactics I've employed in writing this content. Although other secions will be littered with stage direction throughout, _this_ section is almost exclusively stage directions and context setting.
It's one big aside. I hope to keep it short.

So, first, who am I, the author, and why am I writing this? I'm a professional software developer with 46 years of professional programming experience at various levels and in various guises. In an industry that seems to actively punish experience (via age),
I have experience in bulk and all the associated scar tissue. I'm well aware that the profession has changed dramatically over my tenure -- my first editor was a paper tape punch -- but I've kept abreast of the changes and think I can offer some wisdom 
(no, really!) and perspective on the arc of this history. Programming languages come and go, but the goals and strategies for success evolve much more slowly. They _have_ changed, but not as much as that breathless blog post you read this morning would have you
believe.

Every writer has a voice. I have mine. Programming has defined my adult working life. I was taken with it from my very first few programs I blundered through. I've spent many long hours -- some happy, some not -- honing my skills and improving my craft.
I've read extensively about it and about topics that surround programming such as Computer Science and Mathematics. I got paid to do it too, can you believe it? Like Donna Summers, I worked hard for the money and I wasn't always treated right. 
But on good days I made lasting things with my own mind and my own hands. When needed, I mastered the tools and techniques to make them well. I'll often use _Rust_ as a specific term for programming in general since you're programming _using_ Rust
and many programming skills generalize beyond a specific programming language.

I also freely admit I'm a journeyman, even after a lifetime of effort. There are _many_ who are better developers, faster with results and results that run faster. My mediocrity, however, makes me human and keeps me honoest about what I really do and do not
understand. I remember a time when programmers were nerds -- and embraced the irony of it -- not 
Masters of the Universe who were "killin' it" on social media and with venture capitalists. My jealousy notwithstanding -- I'll never own a rowboat, nevermind a yacht -- I take some comfort that 
programming rewards above all else perseverence. You can always get up after falling down. It requires nothing special. Just the willingness to get up again.

Every writer has biases. I have mine. Programming is fascinating even if you don't get paid directly to do it. I think it's a necessary literacy for the modern age and, nutty as this sounds, everyone should have some understanding if not proficiency at it.
If you _can_ get paid and you enjoy it, so much the better. But prepare yourself to embrace the grind. Burnout is common. I'm biased about the separation between the craft of programming -- creating neat things with your mind -- and the profession
of programming -- making products and services for other's consumption for a price. You can write software that you're proud of that no one will buy. There are many software products that are profitable but not particularly elegant.

Programming is both a domain (as in area of study) and a skill and is similar to say playing a musical instrument. Without practice, your skills will atrophy even if your knowledge remains the same. Becoming good is one thing, _remaining_ good requires frequent
and sustained practice. If you like to practice, so much the better. But practice is required. To paraphrase Euclid, there's no royal road to Rust. If you enter the profession -- good for you! -- you will find an emphasis on personal productivity and speed.
Your employer will emphasize it and you should focus on their priorities. But I think this emphasis has become a cult. By all means, don't coast. But don't stop thinking because a deadline looms. Programming professionally also means estimating processionally but, 
like programming itself, that can be improved with pratice.

I'm biased toward _why_. Once you understand the why of something, the what and how become easier. History and evolution can often add color to the why as well. For example, _recursion_ was an active topic of Computer Science research in the late 1950's and
early 1960's. Why? Because some algorithms and data structures such as trees are _much_ easier to implement via recursion. But it came with costs: complexity in compilers, runtime stack space growth, thinking differently as a programmer. But creative
programmers found ways to provide recursion without unacceptable overhead. It's now just another arrow in the quiver. Wasn't always so. 

Second, who are you and why are you reading this? That one's a little harder. Beyond the obvious -- you want to learn how to program with the Rust programming language -- you have some experience programming in another programming language such as python, typescript or even javascript which, yes, are all interpreted languages. You also have some experience with a compiled language like C, C++, Zig or Golang, one that requires a linking step after compilation. This distinction has traditionally been important, but the latest languages have lessened the differences, Rust especially. [TODO mike@carif.io: more here]

More importantly, you have the time, discipline and persistence to learn-by-doing, experiment and practice. I'll be your bush guide. I'll even take you off some of the beaten paths. But this is just the first legs of your journey. 
Along the way I hope you'll learn _fruitful_ ways to experiment. How to break things. How to demonstrate or prove to _yourself_ that something is actually working and workingn and working _well enough_, however you define it. 
How to organize your programs and visualize your data. Some of you will eventually write tutorials and I'll want to read them.
